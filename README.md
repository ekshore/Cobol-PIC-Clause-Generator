# Cobol-PIC-Clause-Generator
This project is takes in a printer spaceing chart in a csv format and creates the nessassary picture clause's in cobol to print that page.

***********
The Current version of the project does not quite handle date edit masks correctly. You will have to go in and manually edit those in the code that is generated.
I plan on fixing this in a future version.
